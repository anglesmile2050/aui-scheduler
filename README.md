# aui-scheduler
this is an update to the aui-scheduler components. via this change, user can create a scheduler with a view of plan and actual comparison.
It uses the original dayview of alloy-ui scheduler to simulate the plan/acutal agenda view. the modification is to show two "days"/two "columns" in the schedulerdayview.
The "day1" in the schedulerdayview stands for the plan and the "day2" in the schedulerdayview stands for actual. this may not be the best solution to add plan/actual comparison for aui-scheduler components. utimately graceful way should be "add a new components" to alloy-ui seperately. this is a TODO task.
